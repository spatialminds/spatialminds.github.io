Overview of US Census Data
https://walker-data.com/census-r/the-united-states-census-and-the-r-programming-language.html

Find a data source
if you're using a shp file, be sure you have the .prj file that specifies the map projection/CRS
Our preferred method of importing data is to download the Geodatabase file, which is an OGC standard file format, that is quite easy to import with QGIS (Our preferred method)

Census Data Download
Download US Census TIGER data as geodatabase files from https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/cartographic-boundary.2023.html#list-tab-1883739534


Do this instead:
The associated 1-Year and 5-Year American Community Survey, can be downloaded from https://censusreporter.tumblr.com/post/73727555158/easier-access-to-acs-data
We'll download the 5year data, as it goes down to the more detailed block group level.  This is National Data (The entire country).
