In order to address the lack of Geographic Information components available to Swift developers we're exploring and developing a full GeoStack.  Each step will be documented in a book, to help future readers learn what a GeoStack is and how they can use it for geo-data exploration, visualization, and geo-processing.  Huzzah!

You can find it in [ Location Intelligence](/geo/introduction.qmd)
