There is very little \"geospatial\" in the Apple Developer ecosystem.\n  - Many C/C++ libraries\n  - Difficult to work with in a \"Swifty\" way.\n\n2. It's difficult to build serious Geospatial Apps for Apple.\n  - No serious GIS apps designed for Apple.  ESRI is 100% Windows.  QGIS is the only serious GIS option on macOS.\n\n2. Data Science and Geo Data Science are more important today than ever. As a Swift Developer I want to be able to create amazing apps for the Apple Ecosystem.\n\n",
