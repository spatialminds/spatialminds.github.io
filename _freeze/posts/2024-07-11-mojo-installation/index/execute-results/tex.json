This article describes the specific steps necessary to install Mojo on macOS and configure it for use with VSCode.\nThis article is current as of 5/1/2024\n\n## Requirements\n- Apple Silicon\n- macOS Monterey (12 or later)\n- Python 3.8-3.12\n- Command Line Tools for XCode\n- Uses Homebrew - I already had it installed.\n- Uses curl - I already had it installed via Homebrew\n\n## Installation\n1.  As a normal user - Install modular\n\n```zsh\n$ curl -s https://get.modular.com | sh -\n```\n\n2.  Setup a modular account\nhttps://developer.modular.com\n\n3.  As a normal user - Authorize the modular client\n```zsh\n$ modular auth\n```\nThis will output a URL, where you can confirm the client in your developer account.  For example:\n\n```zsh\nTo complete auth, open this web page:\nhttps://developer.modular.com/device?userCode=RCDJ-ZCVV\n```\n\n4. As **sudo/root** - Install the Mojo SDK\n\nIf you've attempted an install before, first clean things up\n\n```zsh\n$ modular clean\n```\n\nThen install mojo as **sudo/root**\n```zsh\n\\# sudo modular install mojo\n```\n\n5. Update your zshrc or bashrc\nBe sure to follow the instructions to update your zshrc or .bashrc as described in the output of the previous command.\n\n6.  Test\n```zsh\nmojo --version\n```\n\n## Install VSCode Mojo Extension\n1.  Restart VSCode\nThe VSCode Mojo extension needs the MODULAR_HOME environment variable to work properly.  You can either pick this up from your global environment or you can set it specifically in the VSCode Mojo extension settings.  Since we just updated our MODULAR_HOME environment variable, let's keep it simple and use that.\n\nQuit and Restart VSCode\n\n2.  Find the official Mojo extension for VSCode and install\n\n## VSCode Mojo Test\n1.  Create a file 'hello.mojo'\n2.  Add\n\n```mojo\n  fn main():\n  print(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n3. Run it, and insure you see Hello World in the console output.\n\nCongratulations.  You now have mojo support in VSCode\n\n",
