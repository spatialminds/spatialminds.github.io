  abstract = {Practical needs in geographic information systems (GIS) have led to the investigation of formal and sound methods of describing spatial relations. Arter an introduction to the basic ideas and notions of topology, a novel theory of topological spatial relations between sets is developed in which the relations are defined in tenns of the intersections of the boundaries and interiors of two sets. By consideringemply and non-emptyas the values of'the intersections, a total of sixteen topological spatial relations is described, each of which can be realized in R 2• This set is reduced to nine relations if the sets are restricted to spatial regions, a fairly broad class of subsets of a connected topological space with an application to GIS. It is shown that these relations correspond to some of the standard set theoretical and topological spatial relations between sets such as equality, disjointness and containment in the interior.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, artificial intelligence (AI) is bringing tremendous new opportunities and challenges to geospatial research. Its fast development is powered by theoretical advancement, big data, computer hardware (e.g., the graphics processing unit, or GPU), and high-performance computing platforms that support the development, training, and deployment of AI models within a reasonable amount of time. Recent years have witnessed significant advances in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI), which is the integration of geospatial studies and AI, especially machine learning and deep learning methods and the latest AI technologies in both academia and industry. GeoAI can be regarded as a study subject to develop intelligent computer programs to mimic the processes of human perception, spatial reasoning, and discovery about geographical phenomena and dynamics; to advance our knowledge; and to solve problems in human environmental systems and their interactions, with a focus on spatial contexts and roots in geography or geographic information science (GIScience). Thus, it would require the knowledge of AI theory, programming and computation practices as well as geographic domain knowledge to be competent in GeoAI research. There have already been increasingly collaborative GeoAI studies for GIScience, remote sensing, physical environment, and human society. It is a good time to provide a key reference list for educators, students, researchers, and practitioners to keep up with the latest GeoAI research topics. This bibliographical entry will first review the historical roots for AI in geography and GIScience and then list up to ten selective recent works with annotations that briefly describe their importance for each topic of interest in the GeoAI landscape, ranging from fundamental spatial representation learning to spatial predictions and to various advancements in cartography, earth observation, social sensing, and geospatial semantics.},

This paper discusses three problems about the proposition of “deep learning + cartography”. One is the consistency between the deep learning method and the map space problem solving strategy, based on gradient descent, local correlation, feature reduction and non-linear nature that answer the feasibility of the combination of “deep learning + cartography”; the second is to analyze the challenges faced by the combination of cartography from its unique disciplinary characteristics and technical environment, involving the non-standard organization of map data, professional requirements for sample establishment, the integration of geometric and geographical features, as well as the inherent spatial scale of the map; thirdly, the entry points and specific methods for integrating map making and map application into deep learning are discussed respectively.},

To accomplish this, we first create an open-sourced dataset that includes synthetic (AI-generated) and real-world (human-designed) maps at multiple scales with a variety settings. We subsequently examine four potential ethical concerns that may arise from the characteristics of DALLE 2 generated maps, namely inaccuracies, misleading information, unanticipated features, and reproducibility. We then develop a deep learning-based ethical examination system that identifies those AI-generated maps. Our research emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations in the development and use of AI techniques in cartography, contributing to the growing body of work on trustworthy maps.

  abstract = {Predictive analytics over mobility data is of great importance since it can assist an analyst to predict events, such as collisions, encounters, traffic jams, etc. A typical example is anticipated location prediction, where the goal is to predict the future location of a moving object, given a look-ahead time. What is even more challenging is to be able to accurately predict collective behavioural patterns of movement, such as co-movement patterns as well as their course over time. In this paper, we address the problem of Online Prediction of Co-movement Patterns. Furthermore, in order to be able to calculate the accuracy of our solution, we propose a co-movement pattern similarity measure, which facilitates the comparison between the predicted clusters and the actual ones. Finally, we calculate the clusters’ evolution through time (survive, split, etc.) and compare the cluster evolution predicted by our framework with the actual one. Our experimental study uses two real-world mobility datasets from the maritime and urban domain, respectively, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

Solutions to spatial-scene similarity assessments are sensible only if corresponding elements in the compared scenes are identified correctly. This matching process becomes increasingly complex and error-prone for large spatial scenes as it is questionable how to choose one set of associations over another or how to account quantitatively for unmatched elements. We develop a comprehensive methodology for similarity queries over spatial scenes that incorporates cognitively motivated approaches about scene comparisons, together with explicit domain knowledge about spatial objects and their relations for the relaxation of spatial query constraints. Along with a sound graph-theoretical methodology, this approach provides the foundation for plausible reasoning about spatial-scene similarity queries.},

In a similar fashion, people also perceive such objects as lines and communicate about them accordingly as evidence from research on sketching habits suggests. To facilitate new modalities like sketching that rely on the similarity between qualitative representations, oftentimes multi-resolution models are needed to allow comparisons between sketches and database scenes through successively increasing levels of detail. Within such a setting, topology alone is sufficient only for a coarse estimate of the spatial similarity between two scenes, whereas metric refinements may help extract finer details about the relative positioning and geometry between the objects. The nine-intersection is a topological model that distinguishes 33 relations between two lines based on the content invariant (empty–non-empty intersections) among boundaries, interiors, and exteriors of the lines. This paper extends the nine-intersection model by capturing metric details for line–line relations through splitting ratios and closeness measures. Splitting ratios, which apply to the nine-intersection's non-empty values, are normalized values of lengths and areas of intersections. Closeness measures, which apply to the nine-intersection's empty values, are normalized distances between disjoint object parts. Both groups of measures are integrated into compact representations of topological relations, thereby addressing topological and metric properties of arbitrarily complex line–line relations.},

As a result, technological greenhouses are replacing traditional tin houses as locations for mushroom planting. These greenhouses feature several complex parameters. If we can reduce the complexity such greenhouses and improve the efficiency of their production management using intelligent schemes, technological greenhouses could become the expert assistants of farmers. In this paper, the main goal of the developed system is to measure the mushroom size and to count the amount of mushrooms. According to the results of each measurement, the growth rate of the mushrooms can be estimated. The proposed system also records the data of the mushrooms and broadcasts them to the mobile phone of the farmer. This improves the effectiveness of the production management. The proposed system is based on the convolutional neural network of deep learning, which is used to localize the mushrooms in the image. A positioning correction method is also proposed to modify the localization result. The experiments show that the proposed system has a good performance concerning the image measurement of mushrooms.},

  abstract = {A common need for artificial intelligence models in the broader geoscience is to represent and encode various types of spatial data, such as points (e.g., points of interest), polylines (e.g., trajectories), polygons (e.g., administrative regions), graphs (e.g., transportation networks), or rasters (e.g., remote sensing images), in a hidden embedding space so that they can be readily incorporated into deep learning models. One fundamental step is to encode a single point location into an embedding space, such that this embedding is learning-friendly for downstream machine learning models such as support vector machines and neural networks. We call this process location encoding. However, there lacks a systematic review on the concept of location encoding, its potential applications, and key challenges that need to be addressed. This paper aims to fill this gap. We first provide a formal definition of location encoding, and discuss the necessity of location encoding for GeoAI research from a machine learning perspective. Next, we provide a comprehensive survey and discussion about the current landscape of location encoding research. We classify location encoding models into different categories based on their inputs and encoding methods, and compare them based on whether they are parametric, multi-scale, distance preserving, and direction aware. We demonstrate that existing location encoding models can be unified under a shared formulation framework. We also discuss the application of location encoding for different types of spatial data. Finally, we point out several challenges in location encoding research that need to be solved in the future.},
