  abstract = {Cartography includes two major tasks: map making and map application, which is inextricably linked to artificial intelligence technology. The cartographic expert system experienced the intelligent expression of symbolism. After the spatial optimization decision of behaviorism intelligent expression, cartography faces the combination of deep learning under connectionism to improve the intelligent level of cartography. This paper discusses three problems about the proposition of “deep learning + cartography”. One is the consistency between the deep learning method and the map space problem solving strategy, based on gradient descent, local correlation, feature reduction and non-linear nature that answer the feasibility of the combination of “deep learning + cartography”; the second is to analyze the challenges faced by the combination of cartography from its unique disciplinary characteristics and technical environment, involving the non-standard organization of map data, professional requirements for sample establishment, the integration of geometric and geographical features, as well as the inherent spatial scale of the map; thirdly, the entry points and specific methods for integrating map making and map application into deep learning are discussed respectively.},

Arter an introduction to the basic ideas and notions of topology, a novel theory of topological spatial relations between sets is developed in which the relations are defined in tenns of the intersections of the boundaries and interiors of two sets. By consideringemply and non-emptyas the values of'the intersections, a total of sixteen topological spatial relations is described, each of which can be realized in R 2• This set is reduced to nine relations if the sets are restricted to spatial regions, a fairly broad class of subsets of a connected topological space with an application to GIS. It is shown that these relations correspond to some of the standard set theoretical and topological spatial relations between sets such as equality, disjointness and containment in the interior.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, artificial intelligence (AI) is bringing tremendous new opportunities and challenges to geospatial research. Its fast development is powered by theoretical advancement, big data, computer hardware (e.g., the graphics processing unit, or GPU), and high-performance computing platforms that support the development, training, and deployment of AI models within a reasonable amount of time. Recent years have witnessed significant advances in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI), which is the integration of geospatial studies and AI, especially machine learning and deep learning methods and the latest AI technologies in both academia and industry. GeoAI can be regarded as a study subject to develop intelligent computer programs to mimic the processes of human perception, spatial reasoning, and discovery about geographical phenomena and dynamics; to advance our knowledge; and to solve problems in human environmental systems and their interactions, with a focus on spatial contexts and roots in geography or geographic information science (GIScience). Thus, it would require the knowledge of AI theory, programming and computation practices as well as geographic domain knowledge to be competent in GeoAI research. There have already been increasingly collaborative GeoAI studies for GIScience, remote sensing, physical environment, and human society. It is a good time to provide a key reference list for educators, students, researchers, and practitioners to keep up with the latest GeoAI research topics. This bibliographical entry will first review the historical roots for AI in geography and GIScience and then list up to ten selective recent works with annotations that briefly describe their importance for each topic of interest in the GeoAI landscape, ranging from fundamental spatial representation learning to spatial predictions and to various advancements in cartography, earth observation, social sensing, and geospatial semantics.},

GeoAI, or geospatial artificial intelligence, has become an emerging topic and the frontier for spatial analytics in Geography. This study explores how these technologies can enhance spatial analysis and decision support systems, leading to more accurate, efficient, and sustainable outcomes. The integration of AI and Big Data facilitates improved data acquisition and management, enabling the processing of large volumes of geospatial data. The paper highlighted the applications of AI and Big Data in geography, such as optimizing urban development, environmental monitoring, and disaster management. However, it also acknowledges the challenges, including data privacy and security concerns, potential biases in algorithms, and data quality and integration issues. The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaborations and the development of user-friendly tools and platforms to democratize the adoption of AI and Big Data applications in geography.},

This paper investigates the ethics of using artificial intelligence (AI) in cartography, with a particular focus on the generation of maps using DALLE 2. To accomplish this, we first create an open-sourced dataset that includes synthetic (AI-generated) and real-world (human-designed) maps at multiple scales with a variety settings. We subsequently examine four potential ethical concerns that may arise from the characteristics of DALLE 2 generated maps, namely inaccuracies, misleading information, unanticipated features, and reproducibility. We then develop a deep learning-based ethical examination system that identifies those AI-generated maps. Our research emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations in the development and use of AI techniques in cartography, contributing to the growing body of work on trustworthy maps. We aim to raise public awareness of the potential risks associated with AI-generated maps and support the development of ethical guidelines for their future use.},

  abstract = {Many real and artificial entities in geographic space, such as transportation networks and trajectories of movement, are typically modelled as lines in geographic information systems. In a similar fashion, people also perceive such objects as lines and communicate about them accordingly as evidence from research on sketching habits suggests. To facilitate new modalities like sketching that rely on the similarity between qualitative representations, oftentimes multi-resolution models are needed to allow comparisons between sketches and database scenes through successively increasing levels of detail. Within such a setting, topology alone is sufficient only for a coarse estimate of the spatial similarity between two scenes, whereas metric refinements may help extract finer details about the relative positioning and geometry between the objects. The nine-intersection is a topological model that distinguishes 33 relations between two lines based on the content invariant (empty–non-empty intersections) among boundaries, interiors, and exteriors of the lines. This paper extends the nine-intersection model by capturing metric details for line–line relations through splitting ratios and closeness measures. Splitting ratios, which apply to the nine-intersection's non-empty values, are normalized values of lengths and areas of intersections. Closeness measures, which apply to the nine-intersection's empty values, are normalized distances between disjoint object parts. Both groups of measures are integrated into compact representations of topological relations, thereby addressing topological and metric properties of arbitrarily complex line–line relations.},

Solutions to spatial-scene similarity assessments are sensible only if corresponding elements in the compared scenes are identified correctly. This matching process becomes increasingly complex and error-prone for large spatial scenes as it is questionable how to choose one set of associations over another or how to account quantitatively for unmatched elements. We develop a comprehensive methodology for similarity queries over spatial scenes that incorporates cognitively motivated approaches about scene comparisons, together with explicit domain knowledge about spatial objects and their relations for the relaxation of spatial query constraints. Along with a sound graph-theoretical methodology, this approach provides the foundation for plausible reasoning about spatial-scene similarity queries.},

  abstract = {Predictive analytics over mobility data is of great importance since it can assist an analyst to predict events, such as collisions, encounters, traffic jams, etc. A typical example is anticipated location prediction, where the goal is to predict the future location of a moving object, given a look-ahead time. What is even more challenging is to be able to accurately predict collective behavioural patterns of movement, such as co-movement patterns as well as their course over time. In this paper, we address the problem of Online Prediction of Co-movement Patterns. Furthermore, in order to be able to calculate the accuracy of our solution, we propose a co-movement pattern similarity measure, which facilitates the comparison between the predicted clusters and the actual ones. Finally, we calculate the clusters’ evolution through time (survive, split, etc.) and compare the cluster evolution predicted by our framework with the actual one. Our experimental study uses two real-world mobility datasets from the maritime and urban domain, respectively, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},
